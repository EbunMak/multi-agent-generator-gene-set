0.00%, D2: 27.27%, and D3: 54.55%) with mixed protein ingredients (i.e., chicken 
meal, krill meal, fermented soybean meal, and soy protein concentrate) on the 
growth performance, muscle nutritional composition, blood biochemical indices, 
gut bacterial community, and transcriptome of Chinese perch. Two hundred seventy 
Chinese perch were divided into three groups (90 per group) and the diet lasted 
for 56 days. Results showed that the weight gain rate and specific growth rate 
were significantly lower, and the feed conversion ratio was significantly higher 
in the D3 group than in fish fed D1 (P < 0.05), with no significant differences 
between the D1 and D2 groups (P > 0.05). The muscle crude protein content was 
highest in the D2 group, and the crude fat content was significantly different 
in the order: D3 > D1 > D2 (P < 0.05). The levels of serum triglycerides (TG) 
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the D2 group were significantly lower 
than those in the D1 group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference 
compared to the D3 group (P > 0.05). The microbial community structure changed 
significantly. Mycoplasma showed the highest abundance in the D1 and D2 groups 
(P < 0.05), and Cetobacterium peaked in D2 group, and significantly higher than 
that in D1 group (P < 0.05). Network analysis and cohesion index calculation 
showed that both network complexity and cohesion peaked in D2 group, and 
Cetobacterium was highly correlated with the cohesion index (P < 0.05). Further, 
muscle transcriptome analysis results showed that compared with the control 
group, differentially expressed genes were clustered (Q < 0.05) in the arginine 
and proline metabolism pathways in D2 group. Fish in D3 group significantly 
(Q < 0.05) affected genes involved in KEGG pathways of ribosome, circadian 
rhythm, thermogenesis, insulin signaling pathway, fatty acid degradation, 
oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis. In conclusion, under the experimental 
conditions, the replacement of 27.27% of fish meal by the compound protein did 
not have a negative impact on the growth performance of Chinese perch and could 
improve muscle quality, lipid metabolism, and the interaction of intestinal 
microbiota.",Copyright © 2023 Liyun Ding et al.,"DOI: 10.1155/2023/2915916

derepression of let-7 target genes, some of which are oncogenic (e.g., MYCN) 
potentially contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance. We have 
developed a cell-based assay to identify small molecules that increase levels of 
mature functional let-7 miRNAs by inhibiting the function of Lin28B protein or 
by other means. This system consists of a reporter gene (GFP) regulated by the 
tTR-KRAB repressor protein which in turn is regulated by processed let-7 miRNAs. 
Using this system, we screened approximately 4000 small molecules and identified 
more than a dozen compounds capable of augmenting levels of mature let-7 miRNAs. 
Among those compounds, Kenpaullone and BIO were shown to increase let-7 miRNA 
levels with consequent suppression of MYCN protein in neuroblastoma cell lines. 
This novel strategy provides an additional cell-based assay for candidate cancer 
drug screening in a high throughput setting and will facilitate the 
identification of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, this assay could be used to

prognosis. One form of controlled cell death that requires iron is ferroptosis. 
This study utilized TCGA data analysis to identify differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) related to ferroptosis in OC, revealing 2,333 up-regulated and 
4,073 down-regulated genes. Venn diagrams identified 64 up-regulated and 120 
down-regulated ferroptosis-related DEGs (FR-DEGs), with 15 showing a significant 
correlation with overall patient survival. Further analyses explored the 
expression, mutations, and copy number variations of these 15 FR-DEGs across 
various cancer types, constructing interaction networks. Molecular subtypes in 
OC were classified using these 15 FR-DEGs, revealing two subtypes (C1 and C2). 
Survival analysis identified a risk model for the C1 group based on these genes. 
Experimental validation highlighted TRIM46 as a key gene, with knockdown 
inhibiting OC cell proliferation and migration. TRIM46 was also associated with 
changes in ferroptosis-related markers and demonstrated a close connection with 
the Wnt signaling pathway, validated through Western blot experiments. Overall,

found in humans that causes the majority of urinary tract infections, and other 
infections such as meningitis and sepsis. ExPEC can enter the urinary tract 
through two modes: ascending from the bladder or descending from the kidneys. 
Human anatomical structures generally prevent the transmission of pathogens 
between the extra-intestinal area, kidneys, bladder, and urinary tract. However, 
adhesins, a virulence protein of ExPEC, promote the initial bacterial attachment 
and invasion of host cells. In addition to adhesion proteins, ExPEC contains 
iron acquisition systems and toxins to evade the host immune system, acquire 
essential nutrients, and gain antibiotic resistance. The presence of 
antibiotic-resistant genes makes treating ExPEC in urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) more complicated. Therefore, screening for the presence of ExPEC among 
other uropathogens in UTI patients is essential, as it can potentially aid in 
the effective treatment and mitigation of ExPEC pathogens. Several diagnostic 
techniques are available for detecting ExPEC, including urine culture, 
polymerase chain reaction, serological testing, loop-mediated isothermal 
amplification, and biochemical tests. This review addresses strain-specific 
diagnostic techniques for screening ExPEC in UTI patients.",© 2024 The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1016/j.crmicr.2024.100296

autoimmune disease observed in the oral cavity. It most commonly manifests as 
white papules arranged confluently, drawing a picture of white lines in the form 
of a network (reticular form). It may emerge in other forms as well. In our 
study, the erosive form presents the most clinical interest. Among the 
biomarkers that participate in the tumorigenesis process, DAPK-1 seems 
promising, rendering its study necessary. This study focuses on the 
investigation of the presence of the DAPK-1 using immunohistochemistry in OLP 
compared to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), oral leukoplakia (OL), a 
well-established oral potentially malignant disorder, and normal oral epithelium 
to evaluate its possible role as an early predictor of the possibility of 
malignant transformation risk of OLP lesions. Methods To monitor the expression 
profile of the tumor suppressor protein DAPK-1, an immunohistochemical detection 
took place in 18 samples of OLP (reticular and erosive type), in 22 OSCC samples 
of all degrees of differentiation, in 30 OL samples of all degrees of dysplasia, 
and five normal tissue samples used as the control group. To complete the above 
procedure, immunohistochemistry was used in a semiquantative manner. The 
paraffin-embedded tissue samples were selected from the archives of the 
Department of Oral Medicine/Pathology, School of Dentistry, Aristotle University 
of Thessaloniki, Greece, from biopsies performed in this department as well as 
from St. Lukas Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece, between 2014 and 2019. The 
study was conducted per the Research and Ethics Committee guidelines of 
Aristotle University, School of Dentistry, and the Helsinki II declaration 
(protocol number 29/21.11.2018).  Results The statistical analysis showed that 
there was no statistically significant difference in DAPK-1 staining between 
normal tissues and OLP (p=0.588, independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test). On 
the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference between OSCCs 
and OLPs (p<0,001, independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test), with the extent of 
expression of DAPK-1 being greater in OLP than in OSCC. In addition, there was a 
statistical difference in DAPK-1 expression between OLPs and OLs (p=0,001, 
independent-samples Kruskal-Wallis test), with DAPK-1 being expressed more in 
OLP than in OL. Conclusion The DAPK-1, as a pro-inflammatory with its role as a 
tumor suppressor factor, was highly expressed in OLP, both reticular and 
erosive. The relatively milder expression of DAPK-1 in OL means that, between 
the two disorders, OLP is less likely to progress to oral cancer. On the other 
hand, OLP could also offer the background for further investigation of a 
possible correlation between methylation (immunohistochemical expression of 
proteins, deriving from potentially DNA-methylated genes) and the development of 
inflammation. It appears that DNA methylation is important in the regulation of 
inflammatory genes. Conversely, inflammation may regulate the DNA methylation of 
many genes involved in carcinogenesis and thus should be taken into account when 
studying the methylation behavior of genes such as DAPK-1 in pathologies 
characterized by a sparse inflammatory infiltrate.","Copyright © 2024, Papadopoulos et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.71714

have gained attention for their revolutionary potential in tuberculosis (TB) 
management, providing a novel approach to both diagnostics and treatment. This 
technology, renowned for its ability to accurately target and modify genetic 
material, offers a promising solution to the limitations of current TB 
diagnostic methods, which often rely on time-consuming culture techniques or 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. One of the key advantages of 
CRISPR-Cas systems is their high specificity and sensitivity, making them 
well-suited for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even in low-bacterial-load 
samples. Techniques such as CRISPR-Cas12 and Cas13 have been employed for rapid 
detection, utilizing their trans-cleavage activity to produce a fluorescent 
signal upon recognition of the TB genome. Furthermore, these methods often use 
isothermal amplification techniques like recombinase polymerase amplification 
(RPA) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which require less 
equipment compared to traditional PCR. Beyond diagnostics, CRISPR-Cas 
technologies show promise in studying TB resistance mechanisms and potentially 
treating drug-resistant strains. Genome-editing capabilities enable researchers 
to manipulate the M. tuberculosis genome, investigating genes linked to 
virulence or antibiotic resistance. Although challenges such as the development 
of multiplexed CRISPR assays for detecting multiple mutations simultaneously 
remain, advancements continue to improve the technology's practicality for 
clinical use. Incorporating CRISPR into TB management could enhance early 
detection, inform personalized treatment, and potentially contribute to 
developing more effective therapies, especially in regions where TB remains a 
significant public health threat.","Copyright © 2024, Shetty et al.","DOI: 10.7759/cureus.71697

related to a variety of physiological functions and cardiac disease. However, 
the role of UPR-related genes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been 
well characterized. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the mechanism and 
role of the UPR in the context of AMI.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles related to AMI and UPR pathway were downloaded 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and PathCards database, respectively. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and then functionally 
annotated. The random forest (RF) and least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression analysis were conducted to identify potential 
diagnostic UPR-AMI biomarkers. Furthermore, the results were validated by using 
external data sets, and discriminability was measured by the area under the 
curve (AUC). A nomogram based on the feature genes was developed to predict the 
AMI-risk rate. Then we utilized two algorithms, CIBERSORT and MCPcounter, to 
investigate the relationship between the key genes and immune microenvironment. 
Additionally, we performed uniform clustering of AMI samples based on the 
expression of UPR pathway-related genes. The weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis was conducted to identify the key modules in various clusters, 
enrichment analysis was performed for the genes existing in different modules.
RESULTS: A total of 14 DEGs related to the UPR pathway were identified. Among 
the 14 DEGs, CEBPB, ATF3, EIF2S3, and TSPYL2 were subsequently identified as 
biomarkers by the LASSO and RF algorithms. A diagnostic model was constructed 
with these four genes, and the AUC was 0.939. The calibration curves, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the decision curve analysis of the 
nomogram exhibited good performance. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration 
analysis revealed that four feature genes were linked with the infiltration of 
immune cells such as neutrophils. The cluster analysis of the AMI samples 
identified two distinct clusters, each with differential expression of genes 
related to the UPR pathway, immune cell infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine 
secretion. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis and enrichment analysis 
showed that both clusters were associated with the UPR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of the UPR pathway in the 
pathogenesis of myocardial infarction, and identifies four genes CEBPB, ATF3, 
EIF2S3, and TSPYL2 as diagnostic biomarkers for AMI, providing new ideas for the

liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology 
to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in lung tissues. We then 
performed enrichment analyses of the DEPs using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, and constructed 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
RESULTS: We identified 242 DEPs in the asthmatic mice model and showed that heat 
shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5) is a central protein in asthma. 
Consistent with our bioinformatics analysis, our western blot validation 
confirmed that the protein levels of arginase 1 (ARG1), chitinase-like protein 3 
(CHIL3), chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1), and 
bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) fold-containing family B 
member 1 (BPIFB1) were significantly increased in asthma group compared to the 
control group. Thus, we found that CLCA1 and BPIFB1 were the most promising 
potential biomarkers of asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our iTRAQ analysis and western blot verification of asthmatic mice 
showed that HSPA5 is a central protein in asthma, and CLCA1 and BPIFB1 are novel 
potential biomarkers that could play significant roles in the diagnosis and 
treatment of asthma.",2024 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-24-1366

role in shaping the systemic immune response and influencing the efficacy of 
immunotherapy. In this study, patients with extensive-stage small cell lung 
cancer (ES-SCLC) were included to explore the correlation between gut microbiota 
and metabolites and immunotherapy efficacy in patients with ES-SCLC.
METHODS: Pre- and post-treatment, we collected stool samples from 49 ES-SCLC 
patients treated with an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody. We 
then applied 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) non-targeted metabolomics technology. Subsequently, the gut 
microbiota and metabolites were identified and classified.
RESULTS: The results showed no statistical difference in gut microbiota alpha 
and beta diversity between the responder (R) and non-responder (NR) patients at 
baseline. However, the alpha diversity of the R patients was significantly 
higher than that of the NR patients after treatment. There were also differences 
in the microbiome composition at the baseline and post-treatment. Notably, after 
treatment, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and 
[Ruminococcus]_torques were enriched in the R group, while Dubosiella, 
coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 was enriched in the NR group. The non-targeted 
metabolomics results also indicated that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were 
up-regulated in the R group after treatment. More, differential metabolites were 
enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, 
including the PD-L1 expression and programmed death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint pathway 
in cancer.

(#)Contributed equally","BACKGROUND: Seawater drowning is a leading cause of accidental injury and death, 
and the resulting acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious clinical syndrome for 
which there are no effective treatments. This study aims to investigate the 
potential mechanism of seawater drowning-induced ALI.
METHODS: Seawater drowning mouse models were constructed to assess lung injury. 
The hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining and fluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were used to observe 
the pathology of lung tissues and apoptosis, respectively. 16S rRNA and RNA-seq 
were performed to identify the structure of the intestinal microbes and the gene 
expression profiles of the lung tissue of the mice, respectively. The expression 
of cytokines was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the activities of 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected by assay 
kits.
RESULTS: The results showed that seawater drowning aggravated lung injury and 
accelerated cell apoptosis in mice. Seawater exposure significantly altered the 
structure of mouse intestinal microbes, especially increasing the abundance of 
Firmicutes and decreasing that of Bacteroidota. Transcriptional upregulation of 
inflammatory responses in ALI mice was observed in the lung transcriptome, and 
differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in inflammation-related 
pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, viral protein 
interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, and chemokine signaling 
pathway, which were further confirmed by microbe-gene association analysis. 
Furthermore, inflammatory factors were up-regulated, oxidative stress molecule 
MDA was elevated, and SOD was decreased in the lung tissues of mice, suggesting 
that the imbalance of intestinal flora activated inflammatory and oxidative 
stress responses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the mechanism that intestinal microflora 
aggravates ALI by modulating inflammatory signaling pathways, depicting the 
landscape of the microbial-gene-lung axis and providing new insights into the 
use of gut flora as a therapeutic strategy for ALI.",2024 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.21037/jtd-24-633

significant obstacle. Due to the heterogeneity of each cell subtype and between 
cells within the tumor, the sensitivity and resistance of different patients to 
targeted drugs, chemotherapy, etc., are inconsistent. Concerning a specific 
tumor type, many feasible treatments or combinations can be used by specifically 
targeting the tumor microenvironment. To solve this problem, it is necessary to 
further study the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell sequencing techniques can 
dissect distinct tumor cell populations by isolating cells and using statistical 
computational methods. This technology may assist in the selection of targeted 
combination therapy, and the obtained cell subset information is crucial for the 
rational application of targeted therapy. In this review, we summarized the 
research and application advances of single-cell sequencing technology in the 
tumor microenvironment, including the most commonly used single-cell genomic and 
transcriptomic sequencing, and their future development direction was proposed. 
The application of single-cell sequencing technology has been expanded to 
include epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome analysis. The 
integration of these different omics approaches has significantly advanced the 
development of single-cell multiomics sequencing technology. This innovative 
approach holds immense potential for various fields, such as biological research 
and medical investigations. Finally, we discussed the advantages and

degenerative disease that causes lower back pain. However, the underlying 
mechanisms of IDD remain unclear. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) is a 
newly identified suppressor for ferroptosis. This study aims to investigate the 
role of FSP1 in IDD. Nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues in humans were collected and 
NP cells from rats were isolated to detect FSP1 expression pattern. The 
relationship between FSP1-mediated ferroptosis and apoptosis was identified 
using FSP1 inhibitor iFSP1. RNA sequencing was utilized to seek downstream 
molecules and related signaling pathways. Moreover, both exogenous recombinant 
FSP1 protein and endogenous small interfering RNA were implemented in this study 
to clarify the role of FSP1 in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-mediated NP 
cell apoptosis. Ultimately, the underlying mechanisms of FSP1-related signaling 
pathway in IDD were uncovered both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, FSP1 was 
up-regulated in human degenerative NP tissues and after TNFα stimulation. FSP1 
inhibition by iFSP1 fails to trigger ferroptosis in NP cells while inhibiting 
TNFα-mediated apoptosis. Further experiments demonstrated that FSP1 was closely 
related to TNFα-reliant caspase 3 activation and mitochondrial damage. However, 
the exogenous addition of recombinant protein FSP1 does not induce cell death or 
intensify the efficacy of TNFα. Mechanically, FSP1 is involved in TNFα-mediated 
NF-κB signaling activation to accelerate the development of IDD. This study 
demonstrated that FSP1 promotes IDD through TNFα-reliant NF-κB signaling 
activation and caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. These findings suggested a novel 
therapeutic target for the treatment of IDD.","© 2024 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi

Wnt/β-catenin signaling and a tumor suppressor. The role of NKD2 in osteoblast 
and osteoclast differentiation and the mechanism are not fully understood. In 
this study, we identified the up-regulation of NKD2 during osteoblast and 
adipocyte differentiation. Functional experiments revealed that NKD2 stimulated 
osteoblast differentiation and suppressed adipocyte formation. Furthermore, NKD2 
down-regulated the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand 
in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and inhibited osteoclast formation from 
osteoclast precursor cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the 
regulation of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation by NKD2 involved 
Wnt/β-catenin and tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1 (TSC1)/mechanistic target 
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Unlike in undifferentiated 
mesenchymal cells where NKD2 promoted Dishevelled-1 degradation, in the cells 
differentiating toward osteoblasts or adipocytes NKD2 down-regulated secreted 
frizzled related protein 1/4 expression and failed to destabilize Dishevelled-1, 
thereby activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, NKD2 bound to TSC1 and 
inhibited mTORC1 signaling. Further investigation uncovered an interplay between 
TSC1/mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Finally, transplantation of 
NKD2-overexpressing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into the marrow of mice 
increased osteoblasts, reduced osteoclasts and marrow fat, and partially 
prevented bone loss in ovariectomized mice. This study provides evidence that 
NKD2 in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells reciprocally regulates the 
differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes by modulating Wnt/β-catenin and 
mTORC1 pathways and inhibits osteoclast formation by down-regulating receptor 
activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. It suggests that NKD2 up-regulation may 
ameliorate postmenopausal bone loss.","© 2024 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi

established it as one of the most significant pathogens. The purpose of this 
study was to evaluate antimicrobial resistance and conduct a molecular 
investigation of the virulence genes PslB and PelD in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
species isolated from patients.
METHODOLOGY: One hundred clinical isolates were collected from patients of 
different age groups who were hospitalized in Kermanshah and Sonqor hospitals. 
The isolates were obtained through culture on specific media, biochemical 
confirmatory tests, and gram staining for confirmation. Biofilm production was 
assessed using an indirect quantification method with crystal violet. 
Additionally, antibiotic resistance was determined through the disc various 
method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. 
Finally, the presence of genes related to PlsB and PelD in resistant strains was 
examined using The polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: The results indicate that the highest resistance and lowest sensitivity 
were related to nitrofurantoin 100 μg, while the lowest resistance and highest 
sensitivity were related to cefepime 30 mg. Biofilm phenotypes were categorized 
as weak in 7% (n = 7) of isolates, medium in 13% (n = 13), and high in 80% 
(n = 80). The PslB and PelD genes were identified in 86% (n = 86) and 38% 
(n = 38) of isolates, respectively, while 4% (n = 4) did not possess either of 
these two genes. Additionally, a majority of the isolates exhibited 
multidrug-resistance (87%) due to their moderate-to-high biofilm formation.
CONCLUSION: All isolates were capable of producing biofilm. A significant 
association were between strains with the high biofilm and multidrug-resistance 
species (p < 0.05). Multidrug-resistance (78%) isolates included 28% (n = 28) of 
isolates that were PslB+ PelD+, 45% (n = 45) of isolates that were only PslB+, 
and 5 (n = 5) isolates that were only PelD+. A significant relationship was 
found between the presence of the PslB gene multidrug-resistance and high 
producer (p < 0.05).",© The Author(s) 2024.,"DOI: 10.1177/20503121241298826

endometrium, is the most common type of endometrial malignasis. This 
gynecological malignancy is very common all over the world, especially in 
developed countries and shows a potentially rising trend correlated with the 
increase in obese women.
METHODS: Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) analysis was conducted on GSE7305 
and GSE25628 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). DEGs were 
identified using GEO2R (adjusted p-value <0.05, |logFC| > 1). Pathway analysis 
employed KEGG and Gene Ontology databases, while protein-protein interactions 
were analyzed using Cytoscape and Gephi. GEPIA was used for target gene 
validation.
RESULTS: We have identified 304 common DEGs and 78 hub genes using GEO and PPI 
analysis, respectively. The GO and KEGG pathways analysis revealed enrichment of 
DEGs in extracellular matrix structural constituent, extracellular space, cell 
adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction. GEPIA analysis identified three genes, 
ENG, GNG4, and ECT2, whose expression significantly differed between normal and 
tumor samples.
CONCLUSION: This analysis study identified the hub genes and associated pathways

adjacent normal tissues. Using GSE57897 gene expression data from 422 BC samples 
and 31 breast samples from healthy controls which was based on the Platform 
GPL18722 (spotted oligonucleotide Homo sapiens microRNA (miRNA) array) in the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and compare with miRNAs with a conserved target 
location on CST7 mRNA were found using databases. The study population included 
60 fresh BC tissue samples and adjacent normal tissues as control. The 
Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to evaluate the expression levels of CST7 
and has-miR-4793-5p in the breast tissues. The present study, found that CST7 
and hsa-miR-4793-5p were significantly increased in tumoral tissues in compare 
to normal tissues. Further analysis revealed a remarkable association between 
CST7 and hsa-miR-4793-5p gene expression alteration. ROC curve analysis 
demonstrated high accuracy for CST7 expression in BC tumors. Comparison of gene 
expression between different stages and patient family history showed 
significant findings. Due to the high sensitivity and specificity of the 
expression changes of these two genes, they are suitable candidates for further 
investigations to be considered as part of a diagnosis and prognosis panel.",© 2024 The Authors.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2024.101863
