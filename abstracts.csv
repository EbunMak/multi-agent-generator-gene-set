potential viability and clinical impact of reporting genetic variants associated 
with drug-induced toxicity for patients with cancer recruited for whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS) as part of a genomic medicine service.
METHODS: Germline WGS from 76,805 participants was analyzed for pharmacogenetic 
(PGx) variants in four genes (DPYD, NUDT15, TPMT, UGT1A1) associated with 
toxicity induced by five drugs used in cancer treatment (capecitabine, 
fluorouracil, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, irinotecan). Linking genomic data 
with prescribing and hospital incidence records, a phenome-wide association 
study (PheWAS) was performed to identify whether phenotypes indicative of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were enriched in drug-exposed individuals with the 
relevant PGx variants. In a subset of 7,081 patients with cancer, DPYD variants 
were reported back to clinicians and outcomes were collected.
RESULTS: We identified clinically relevant PGx variants across the four genes in 
62.7% of participants in our cohort. Extending this to annual prescription 
numbers in England for the drugs affected by these PGx variants, approximately 
14,540 patients per year could potentially benefit from a reduced dose or 
alternative drug to reduce the risk of ADRs. Validating PGx associations in a 
real-world data set, we found a significant association between PGx variants in 
DPYD and toxicity-related phenotypes in patients treated with capecitabine or 
fluorouracil. Reported DPYD variants were deemed informative for clinical 
decision making in a majority of cases.
CONCLUSION: Reporting PGx variants from germline WGS relevant to patients with 
cancer alongside primary findings related to their cancer can be clinically 
informative, informing prescribing to reduce the risk of ADRs. Extending the 
range of actionable variants to those found in patients of non-European ancestry 
is important and will extend the potential clinical impact.","DOI: 10.1200/JCO.23.02761

cancer (OC) associated genes are candidates for cancer risk-reducing strategies. 
Limited information is available regarding risk-reducing surgeries (RRS) among 
Hispanics. The aim of this study was to describe the uptake of RRS in an 
international real-world experience of Hispanic women referred for genetic 
cancer risk assessment (GCRA) and to identify factors affecting uptake.
METHODS: Between July 1997 and December 2019, Hispanic women, living in the 
United States or in Latin America, enrolled in the Clinical Cancer Genomics 
Community Research Network registry were prospectively included. Demographic 
characteristics and data regarding RRS were obtained from chart reviews and 
patient-reported follow-up questionnaires. Median follow-up was 41 months.
RESULTS: Among 1,736 Hispanic women referred for GCRA, 27.2% women underwent 
risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM), 25.5% risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) 
and, 10.7% both surgeries. Among BRCA carriers, rates of RRM and RRSO were 47.6% 
and 56.7%, respectively. In the multivariate analyses, being a carrier of a BC 
susceptibility gene (odds ratio [OR], 3.44), personal history of BC (OR, 6.22), 
living in the US (OR, 3.90), age ≤50 years (OR, 1.68) and, family history of BC 
(OR, 1.56) were associated with a higher likelihood of undergoing RRM. Carrying 
an OC susceptibility gene (OR, 6.72) was associated with a higher likelihood of 
undergoing RRSO.
CONCLUSION: The rate of RRS among Hispanic women is suboptimal. PV carriers, 
women with personal history of cancer, and those with a family history of cancer 
were more likely to have RRS, with less uptake outside the US. Understanding 
personal and systemic factors influencing uptake may enable interventions to 
increase risk appropriate uptake of RRS.","DOI: 10.1200/GO.24.00097

process. The lack of synchronized rhythms, mainly those showing a circadian 
basis, like sleep, the heart rate (HR) and arterial blood pressure (BP), often 
leads to several organic challenges, usually associated with adverse outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether the intensive care 
unit (ICU) environment favors clock genes and cardiorespiratory changes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 22 critically ill patients (16 males; 72.73%) 
with a mean age of 60.82 ±20.07 years and well-established cardiovascular 
conditions were selected from ICU. Blood samples were obtained, and total RNA 
was isolated and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA). A 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to assess the target 
gene expression levels. The urinary concentration levels of melatonin (MEL) were 
assessed. The heart rate, BP (systolic - SBP, diastolic - DBP and mean - MBP) 
and the oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels were assessed as continuous variables.
RESULTS: The urinary MEL and Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) levels 
were shown to have a non-linear relationship with HR (coefficient (coef): 2.318, 
p = 0.032; coef: 2.722, p = 0.006, respectively) and SBP (coef: 1.000, p = 
0.008; coef: 2.000, p = 0.037, respectively), with an explanatory power of up to 
50.3% and 39.7% of the HR and SBP variability, respectively. Melatonin, but not 
BMAL1, was also shown to have a non-linear relationship with MBP (coef: 1.000, p 
= 0.007), with an explanatory power of up to 31.3% regarding the MBP 
variability. The HR and SBP oscillatory dynamics was shown to be related to 
changes in the genetic expression of BMAL1 and the urinary MEL concentrations. 
To a lower degree, MEL also impacted the variation of MBP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not only are circadian functional matrices 
crucial for the dynamics of vital parameters in critically ill patients, but 
also that routinely assessed cardiovascular parameters like HR and BP may 
constitute important markers for the circadian timing system function. These 
parameters are easy to assess and have a relevant prognostic value regarding 
recovery outcomes, as well as the morbidity and mortality rates in ICU.","DOI: 10.17219/dmp/191537

(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake 
City, Utah 84112, United States.","Plasmodium malaria parasites retain an essential mitochondrional electron 
transport chain (ETC) that is critical for growth within humans and mosquitoes 
and is a key antimalarial drug target. ETC function requires cytochromes c and 
c1, which are unusual among heme proteins due to their covalent binding to heme 
via conserved CXXCH sequence motifs. Heme attachment to these proteins in most 
eukaryotes requires the mitochondrial enzyme holocytochrome c synthase (HCCS) 
that binds heme and the apo cytochrome to facilitate the biogenesis of the 
mature cytochrome c or c1. Although humans encode a single bifunctional HCCS 
that attaches heme to both proteins, Plasmodium parasites are like yeast and 
encode two separate HCCS homologues thought to be specific for heme attachment 
to cyt c (HCCS) or cyt c1 (HCC1S). To test the function and specificity of 
Plasmodium falciparum HCCS and HCC1S, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to tag both genes for 
conditional expression. HCC1S knockdown selectively impaired cyt c1 biogenesis 
and caused lethal ETC dysfunction that was not reversed by the overexpression of 
HCCS. Knockdown of HCCS caused a more modest growth defect but strongly 
sensitized parasites to mitochondrial depolarization by proguanil, revealing key 
defects in ETC function. These results and prior heterologous studies in 
Escherichia coli of cyt c hemylation by P. falciparum HCCS and HCC1S strongly 
suggest that both homologues are essential for mitochondrial ETC function and 
have distinct specificities for the biogenesis of cyt c and c1, respectively, in 
parasites. This study lays a foundation to develop novel strategies to 
selectively block ETC function in malaria parasites.","DOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.4c00450

sows being particularly vulnerable. Understanding the mechanisms involved in HS 
response could aid in developing effective strategies against the negative 
impacts on livestock. Recent genome wide association studies identified two core 
circadian clock genes as potential candidates in mediating HS response. The 
study aimed to investigate how cooling lactating sows under natural heat stress 
conditions impacted circadian patterns of respiration rate (RR), rectal 
temperature (RT), behavior, salivary melatonin and cortisol levels, and diurnal 
patterns of cytokines in saliva. Mixed parity lactating sows were assigned to 
one of two treatment groups: electronic cooling pad (C; n = 9) and heat-stressed 
(H; n = 9). The experiment spanned two 48 h periods of elevated ambient 
temperatures due to summer heat wave. In the first 48 h period, RR was recorded 
every 30 min, RT every 60 min, and behaviors (eating, standing, sitting, laying, 
sleeping, drinking, and nursing) every 5 min. In the second 48 h period, saliva 
samples were collected every 4 h. Cooling reduced RR and RT and altered 
circadian patterns (P < 0.05). Cooling did not affect amount of time engaged in 
any behavior over the 48 h period (P > 0.05), however, daily patterns of eating, 
standing and laying differed between the treatments (P < 0.05), with altered 
eating behavior related to RT increment in H sows (P < 0.05). Cooling increased 
and altered the circadian pattern of salivary melatonin (P < 0.05). Cooling also 
influenced the diurnal pattern of saliva cytokines. Cooling had no impact on 
saliva cortisol levels. In conclusion, cooling HS sows impacted circadian 
rhythms of physiology and behavior, supporting the need for further research to 
understand if circadian disruption underlies decreased production efficiency of 
HS animals.","Copyright: © 2024 Ogundare et al. This is an open access article distributed

show that the specific arrangement of a promoter followed immediately by a

identifiability problem for the model, since the activity of one element can be 
partially compensated for by the other. We also simulate ϕX174 gene expression 
with two additional, putative transcription regulatory elements that have been 
proposed in prior studies. We find that the activities of these putative 
elements are estimated to be weak, and that variation in ϕX174 transcript

initiation of noninfectious gastric ulcers. Probiotics based on a specific 
strain can mitigate gastric damage. However, the protective effects of 
Pediococcus acidilactici (GKA4) and Lactobacillus brevis (GKL93) against 
alcohol-induced gastric mucosal damage remain unclear. Hence, the 
gastroprotective effects of these probiotic strains were investigated in BALB/c 
mice with gastric mucosa damage induced by absolute alcohol. The results 
revealed that preadministration of GKA4 and GKL93 increased the expression of 
antioxidative enzymes (SOD, catalase, GPx), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 
and IL-10), and heat shock protein genes (HSP70 and HSP90) and decreased the 
expression of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-3), MDA, 
and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). Mechanistically, GKA4 
and GKL93 increased the relative abundance of beneficial flora (Coriobacteriia, 
Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Roseburia, f__Oscillospiraceae unclassified, 
Ruminococcus, Adlercreutzia, and [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum_group) that may 
promote antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects via upregulation of the 
expression of proteins in the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and downregulation of the 
expression of proteins in the NF-κB/iNOS/COX-2 signaling pathway, subsequently 
attenuating gastrointestinal permeability and ulcer symptoms. Furthermore, 
correlation analysis revealed that [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum_group and 
f_Oscillospiraceae_unclassified were two significant beneficial flora associated

GKL93 against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in mice include suppressing 
oxidative- and inflammatory-related pathways and modulation of the gut 
microbiota. This novel finding highlights the potential of these probiotics as 
functional materials in preventing alcohol-induced gastric mucosal damage.","DOI: 10.1039/d4fo04106b

development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, the 
features of the transcriptome of these cells associated with the disease remain 
poorly understood.
AIM: : The aim of the study was to perform monocyte transcriptome analysis for 
identification of differentially expressed genes and key disturbances in 
biological processes in these cells in COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: . The study included three COPD patients and three 
smokers without bronchial obstruction. Monocytes were obtained from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells using the plastic adhesion method. The cell purity 
achieved as a result of enrichment was approximately 90% according to flow 
cytometry data. The isolated RNA samples were purified from genomic DNA and 
ribosomal RNA. The samples were sequenced on a MGISEQ-200 sequencer in SE50 
mode. Read mapping and transcript counting were performed in Salmon v1.10.1 
software; further data processing was carried out in R software environment.
RESULTS: : As a result of the analysis, 21 upregulated and 29 downregulated 
genes were found in monocytes from COPD patients. Among the genes with increased 
expression, the most significant were the noncoding RNAs PKD1P5-LOC105376752 and 
PKD1P4-NPIPA8, the role of which remains unclear, as well as SETDB2, RNASE6, 
SERPINE1, and MRC1. Downregulated genes, of which F8A2, ZDHHC19, CXCL9, CXCL10, 
HBA1, HBB, C2, CFB, CFD, MT1B, MT1G, and TIMP3 were of most interest, showed 
enrichment in seven gene ontology (GO) terms, including those related to 
response to lipopolysaccharides, hydrogen peroxide, copper ions, and complement 
activation.
CONCLUSIONS: . The data obtained indicate inhibition of monocyte functional 
activity in COPD patients with a decrease in the ability to provide effective 
protection against microbial pathogens while weakening self-protection against 
reactive oxygen species. Upregulation of SERPINE1 and downregulation of TIMP3 
may significantly contribute to airway remodeling and emphysema development in 
COPD.","© 2024. Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","DOI: 10.1134/S1607672924701199

mouse head on the brain cells damage, behavior, and cognition and to examine the 
possibility of using lactoferrin (LF) to alleviate radiation-induced 
impairments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Mouse heads were irradiated in a beam of neutrons and 
gamma rays from the IR-8 nuclear reactor. The brain cells of control and 
irradiated mice were isolated using Percoll. Neurons and resting and activated 
microglial cells were analyzed using the fluorescently labeled antibodies and 
flow cytometry. The level of DNA double-strand breaks in neurons was determined 
by γH2AX histone content. Cytokine gene expression in the hippocampus was 
studied by RT-PCR. Behavior and cognitive functions were studied using the open 
field, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. LF was isolated 
from female colostrum by preparative ion-exchange chromatography and purified by 
affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose.
RESULTS: : γ,n-Irradiation of the mouse head at a dose of 1.5 Gy led to an 
increase in the level of DNA double-strand breaks in neurons. Twenty-four hours 
after irradiation the total number of cells and the number of neurons in the 
isolated fraction of brain cells decreased, but the number of microglial cells 
remained unchanged. The number of resting and activated microglia did not change 
within 3-72 h after γ,n-irradiation. The expression level of the TNFα, IL-1β, 
and IL-6 genes increased 2 months after γ,n-irradiation of the mouse head at a 
dose of 1.5 Gy, indicating the development of neuroinflammation. At this time, 
irradiated mice demonstrated the anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial and 
episodic memory. A single i.p. administration of human LF to mice immediately 
after γ,n-irradiation of the head did not affect the observed radiation-induced 
disturbances, but decreased the gene expression levels of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the gene expression level of TGFβ 
anti-inflammatory cytokine in the hippocampus 2 months after radiation exposure. 
The obtained results indicate a partial decrease in the level of hippocampal 
neuroinflammation of irradiated animals treated with LF.
CONCLUSIONS: . γ,n-Irradiation of the mouse head at a dose of 1.5 Gy leads to 
DNA damage of neurons and the decrease in the number of neurons. Microglia cells 
are more resistant to such radiation exposure. Late after head-only 
γ,n-irradiation, mice develop neuroinflammation, which is detected by an 
increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the hippocampus and 
also by anxiety-like behavior and impaired cognitive functions. A single LF 
administration leads to a partial decrease in the neuroinflammation level, but 
does not affect the other studied parameters. The optimal dosing regimen of LF 
remains to be determined to preserve cognitive functions after γ,n-irradiation 
of the brain.","© 2024. Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","DOI: 10.1134/S1607672924701205

(#)Contributed equally","Cancer cells encounter unavoidable stress during tumor growth. The 
stress-induced transcription factor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), 
has been reported to upregulate various adaptive genes involved in salvage 
pathways to alleviate stress and promote tumor progression. However, this effect 
is unknown in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In this study, we found 
that ATF4 expression was remarkably upregulated in tumor tissues and associated 
with poor ccRCC outcomes. ATF4 depletion significantly impaired ccRCC cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the 
AKT/mTOR and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related signaling pathway. 
RNA sequencing and functional studies identified nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) as a 
key downstream target of ATF4 for repressing ferroptosis and promoting ccRCC 
cell survival. In addition, targeting ATF4 or pharmacological inhibition using 
NUPR1 inhibitor ZZW115 promoted antitumor immunity in syngeneic graft mouse 
models, represented by increased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. 
Furthermore, ZZW115 could improve the response to the PD-1 immune checkpoint 
blockade. The results demonstrate that the ATF4/NUPR1 signaling axis promotes 
ccRCC survival and facilitates tumor-mediated immunosuppression, providing a set 
of potential targets and prognostic indicators for ccRCC patients.",© 2024. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s12672-024-01485-0

and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), show significant differences in their 
renal clearance. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated, 
but selective tubular transport protein-mediated mechanisms likely play a role. 
In the present study, we investigate the human heteromeric transporter 
b0,+AT-rBAT (encoded by the SLC7A9 and SLC3A1 genes) as a potential candidate 
because it is localized in the luminal membrane of human proximal tubule cells 
and capable of mediating the cellular uptake of amino acids, including 
L-arginine. Double-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably 
expressing human b0,+AT-rBAT exhibited significant uptake of L-arginine and 
L-homoarginine, with apparent Km values of 512.6 and 197.0 μM, respectively. On 
the contrary, ADMA uptake was not saturated up to 4000 μM, with a transport 
rate > 5 nmol × mg protein-1 × min-1. With an IC50 value of 115.8 μM, L-arginine 
inhibited L-homoarginine uptake. Conversely, L-arginine only exhibited a partial 
inhibitory effect on ADMA uptake. Taken together, our data indicate that 
b0,+AT-rBAT may contribute to the differential renal handling of L-arginine, 
L-homoarginine, and ADMA.",© 2024. The Author(s).,"DOI: 10.1007/s00210-024-03510-z

pathophysiology, we study here their precise function in experimental 
osteoporosis. Gene profiling of osteal macrophages from ovariectomized mice 
demonstrated the upregulation of genes that were involved in oxidative stress, 
cell senescence and apoptotic process. A scRNA-seq analysis revealed that osteal 
macrophages were heterogenously clustered into 6 subsets that expressed 
proliferative, inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and efferocytosis gene 
signatures. Importantly, postmenopausal mice exhibited a 20-fold increase in 
subset-3 that showed a typical gene signature of cell senescence and 
inflammation. These findings suggest that the decreased production of estrogen 
due to postmenopause altered the osteal macrophages subsets, resulting in a 
shift toward cell senescence and inflammatory conditions in the bone 
microenvironment. Furthermore, adoptive macrophage transfer onto calvarial bone 
was performed and mice that received oxidative-stressed macrophages exhibited 
greater osteolytic lesions than control macrophages, suggesting the role of 
these cells in development of inflammaging in bone microenvironment.

marrow, where interactions with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) shape disease 
trajectory. We modeled these interactions with tumor-MSC co-cultures and used an 
integrated transcriptome-proteome-network-analyses workflow to identify a 
comprehensive catalog of contact-induced changes. Conditioned media from MSCs 
failed to recapitulate genes and proteins, some borrowed and others 
tumor-intrinsic, induced in cancer cells by direct contact. Protein-protein 
interaction networks revealed the rich connectome between 'borrowed' and 
'intrinsic' components. Bioinformatics prioritized one of the 'borrowed' 
components, CCDC88A/GIV, a multi-modular metastasis-related protein that has 
recently been implicated in driving a hallmark of cancer, growth signaling 
autonomy. MSCs transferred GIV protein to ER+ breast cancer cells (that lack 
GIV) through tunnelling nanotubes via connexin (Cx)43-facilitated intercellular 
transport. Reinstating GIV alone in GIV-negative breast cancer cells reproduced 
approximately 20% of both the 'borrowed' and the 'intrinsic' gene induction 
patterns from contact co-cultures; conferred resistance to anti-estrogen drugs; 
and enhanced tumor dissemination. Findings provide a multiomic insight into

suggests that the ways people think, feel, and behave in close relationships are 
shaped by the dynamic interplay between their genes and their social 
environment. Research on adult attachment, however, has largely focused on the 
latter, providing only a partial picture of how attachment styles emerge and 
develop throughout life. The present research leveraged data from the Minnesota 
Twin Registry, a large sample of older adult twins (N = 1,377 twins; 678 pairs; 
Mage = 70.40 years, SD = 5.42), to examine the relative contributions of genetic 
and environmental factors to adult attachment styles. Participants reported on 
both their general attachment styles and relationship-specific attachments to 
their mothers, fathers, partners, and best friends. The results suggest that 
attachment styles are partly heritable (∼36%) and partly attributable to 
environmental factors that are not shared between twins (∼64%). Heritability 
estimates were somewhat higher for parent-specific attachment styles (∼51%), 
whereas nonshared environmental factors accounted for larger proportions of the 
variance in partner- and best friend-specific attachment styles. Using 
multivariate biometric models, we also examined the genetic and environmental 
factors underlying the covariation among people's relationship-specific 
attachment styles. The findings indicate that the similarities among people's 
avoidant tendencies in different relationships can be explained by a single, 
higher order latent factor (e.g., global avoidance). In contrast, the genetic 
and environmental factors underlying attachment anxiety appear to be more 
differentiated across specific close relationships. (PsycInfo Database Record

prognosis and a potential favorable response to HER2 inhibitors. 
Immunohistochemistry for the HER2 receptor is a universally accepted surrogate 
test for HER2 amplification, but no standardized scoring system currently exists 
for cervical carcinomas. In this study, we investigated HER2 overexpression in 
cervical squamous cell carcinoma and correlated it with HER2 amplification using 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular methods. Seventy-two 
cases of human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer were retrospectively 
reviewed, and at least 2 representative tumor sections were stained for HER2. 
HER2 scoring was performed using the 2018 American Society of Clinical 
Oncology/College of American Pathologist breast cancer criteria, and cases with 
equivocal (2+) to positive (3+) expression were analyzed for HER2 amplification 
using FISH and next-generation sequencing. The average patient age was 50 yrs 
(range: 27-85 yr), with most patients being African American (73.6%) and 
diagnosed at FIGO stage I (65.3%). Nineteen (26.4%) had equivocal HER2 
expression and 4 (5.5%) showed positive expression. Three of the 4 cases with 
positive expression had enough tumors for FISH, and all 3 were amplified. Three 
cases with equivocal expression showed HER2 polysomy on FISH, and none showed 
HER2 amplification. Late clinical stage, high tumor grade, and regional lymph 
node metastasis were significantly correlated with HER2 overexpression and HER2 
amplification. Next-generation sequencing of the 3 HER2-amplified tumors showed 
amplification of various genes, including CD274, JAK2, BIRC3, and ERBB2, and a
