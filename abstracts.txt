"BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a global health issue. Epigenetic 
changes play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
SUMMARY: DKD is currently the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. 
Although much is known about the pathophysiology of DKD, the research field of 
epigenetics is relatively new. Several recent studies have demonstrated that 
diabetes-induced dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms alters the expression of 
pathological genes in kidney cells. If these changes persist for a long time, 
the so-called ""metabolic memory"" could be established. In this review, we 
highlight diabetes-induced epigenetic modifications associated with DKD. While 
there is a substantial amount of literature on epigenetic changes, only a few 
studies describe the underlying molecular mechanisms. Detailed analyses have 
shown that epigenetic changes play an important role in known pathological 
features of DKD, such as podocyte injury, fibrosis, accumulation of 
extracellular matrix, or oxidative injury, all of which contribute to the 
pathophysiology of disease. The transforming growth factor-β plays a key role as 
it is involved in all-mentioned epigenetic types of regulation.
KEY MESSAGES: Epigenetic is crucial for the development and progression of DKD, 
but the detailed molecular mechanisms have to be further analyzed more in 
detail."
"Carbapenems are the last-resort antibiotics used to treat infections caused by 
bacterial pathogens. Many bacterial pathogens have evolved to produce NDM 
carbapenemases to hydrolyze carbapenems, posing a great challenge to public 
health. In this study, we report a multidrug resistant clinical E. coli strain 
673. Strain 673 belongs to sequence type (ST) 1431 and carries several plasmids, 
p673-blaTEM-1B, p673-blaCTX-M-55, p673-blaNDM-5, p673-13272, and p673-6468. 
p673-blaNDM-5 is an IncHI2/IncHI2A-type plasmid harboring several antibiotic 
resistance genes, including bla NDM-5, strA, strB, and dfrA. The bla NDM-5 gene 
was surrounded by two IS26 elements in p673-blaNDM-5, indicating that IS26 could 
mediate the integration of bla NDM-5 into p673-blaNDM-5. p673-blaCTX-M-55 is an 
IncFII-type plasmid harboring fosA, aadA1, and bla CTX-M-55. p673-blaTEM-1B is 
an IncFIB-type plasmid harboring bla TEM-1B and dfrA5. p673-13272 is a 
ColRNAI-type plasmid that does not carry any drug resistance genes. This is the 
first report that a bla NDM-5-bearing IncHI2/IncHI2A-type plasmid has emerged in 
a clinical E. coli strain in China. Our findings suggest that IS26 mediates the 
integration of bla NDM-5 into p673-blaNDM-5. The spread of bla NDM-5-bearing 
plasmids is a clinical challenge and endangers public health."
"BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis (DM) is an inflammatory muscle disease that 
increases the risk of cancer, although the precise connection is not fully 
understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms linking DM 
to cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We conducted differential gene expression analysis on the GSE128470 
dataset and employed WGCNA to pinpoint key genes related to DM. Central genes 
were identified with the LASSO and SVM-RFE methods. The expression levels and 
diagnostic relevance of these genes were confirmed via the GSE1551 dataset. 
Immune cell infiltration was analyzed in relation to central genes, and RT‒qPCR 
was utilized to evaluate the expression of key genes across various cancers.
RESULTS: In total, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), involved mainly in 
innate immunity, cytokine responses, and autoimmune diseases, were identified. 
In the WGCNA, 399 significant genes related to DM were identified, with central 
genes including MIF, C1QA, and CDKN1A. Immune infiltration analysis revealed 
diverse immune cell populations in DM patients, with significant correlations 
between central genes and these immune cells. MIF levels were notably elevated 
in various tumors and correlated with the prognosis of specific cancers. 
Furthermore, MIF was negatively associated with most immune cells but positively 
correlated with CD4+ Th1 cells, NKT cells, and MDSCs. Factors such as immune 
regulatory elements, TMB, and MSI indicated that MIF may affect immunotherapy 
outcomes. The increased expression of MIF mRNA was confirmed via RT‒qPCR.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that MIF, C1QA, and CDKN1A are 
differentially expressed in DM patients, with MIF showing significant 
alterations in DM patients with cancer. MIF may serve as a crucial prognostic 
biomarker and therapeutic target for various cancers, playing a pivotal role in 
linking DM to cancer through the modulation of CD4+ Th1 cells, NKT cells, and 
MDSCs."
"BACKGROUND: Targeting ferroptosis is an effective approach to mitigate hepatic 
fibrosis, yet no reports exist on the ferroptosis signature in liver fibrosis. 
This study aimed to explore ferroptosis characteristics in this disease.
METHODS: RNAseq data from GSE6764, GSE188604 and Cancer Genome Atlas Liver 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) were downloaded. Multiple machine learning 
methods, including Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Random 
Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to identify core genes 
in liver fibrosis and ferroptosis. WGCNA can pinpoint modules linked to clinical 
traits, aiding in discovering diagnostic and progression molecules in complex 
diseases. RF and SVM are often utilized for WGCNA validation to boost result 
accuracy. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was used to establish a mouse liver 
fibrosis model to validate core gene expression, which was also assessed in test 
and validation GEO datasets. Finally, the diagnostic role of the core genes in 
liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was also investigated using 
ROC analysis.
RESULTS: Multiple machine learning methods screened nine core genes, including 
IL1B, GSTZ1, LIFR, SLC25A37, PTGS2, MT1G, HSPB1, ESR1, and PHGDH. In vivo 
experimental validation, RT-PCR showed ESR1 and GSTZ1 were significantly 
under-expressed in the liver fibrosis group compared to the normal group. 
Simultaneously, in GSE6764 and GSE188604, ESR1 and GSTZ1 were also identified as 
protective genes for liver fibrosis. More in-depth research found that ESR1 and 
GSTZ1 exhibited a good diagnostic performance both in liver fibrosis and HCC, 
suggesting that a persistent decrease in ESR1 and GSTZ1 in patients might signal 
the progression from hepatic fibrosis to HCC.
CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to report the ferroptosis signature 
in liver fibrosis and identifies two novel biomarkers, ESR1 and GSTZ1, providing 
new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of liver fibrosis in the future."
"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify and characterize novel PANoptosis 
biomarkers for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis.
METHODS: Transcriptomic data from training set GSE196399 and validation sets 
GSE94916 and GSE202947 were utilized. A PANoptosis gene set was identified by 
intersecting DEGs linked to CAP, WGCNA hub genes, and PANoptosis-related genes. 
GO and KEGG analyses were conducted for enrichment analysis. PANoptosis scores 
were calculated via ssGSEA. Feature genes were identified using SVM-RFE, LASSO 
regression, and RF methods. Diagnostic performance was assessed via ROC 
analysis. Immune cell infiltration was evaluated using CIBERSORT. A PPI network 
was constructed, and a nomogram was developed for CAP prediction. Drug-gene 
interactions were investigated. qRT-PCR was conducted to confirm feature gene 
alterations in clinical samples.
RESULTS: We identified 7555 DEGs associated with CAP from the GSE196399 dataset. 
Through WGCNA, a PANoptosis gene set of 39 genes was found, showing significant 
enrichment in pathways related to apoptosis and inflammation. CAP patients 
exhibited significantly reduced PANoptosis scores compared to healthy controls, 
with a marked upregulation in the majority of the PANoptosis gene set in 
high-score individuals. Four feature genes (ZNF304, AKT3, MAPK8, and ARHGAP10) 
were identified as potential biomarkers, exhibiting high diagnostic accuracy 
with AUCs generally above 0.8. These genes also showed significant correlations 
with M0 macrophages and neutrophils. Drug-gene interaction analysis revealed 
potential therapeutic agents targeting MAPK8 and AKT3. Validation in clinical 
samples confirmed gene expression alterations in CAP patients.
CONCLUSION: The identified PANoptosis feature genes demonstrate high diagnostic 
accuracy for CAP, serving as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
CAP."
"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative and chronic joint disease, is 
essential for identifying novel biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of OA.
METHODS: We collected 35 OA patients and 32 healthy controls from four clinical 
cohorts and 8 real-world samples from our institute. The activation status of 
7530 signalling pathways was calculated via the gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) algorithm. Ten machine learning algorithms and 101 algorithm combinations 
were further applied to recognize the most diagnostic genes. KDELR3 was chosen 
for further validation via immunohistochemical staining to determine its 
diagnostic value in real-world samples.
RESULTS: Sixteen pathways, namely, the cellular respiration chain, protein 
transport, lysosomal and endocytosis pathways, were activated in OA patients. A 
total of 101 types of algorithm combinations were considered for the diagnostic 
model, and 58 were successfully output. The two-step model of glmBoost plus RF 
had the highest average AUC value of 0.95 and was composed of LY86, SORL1, 
KDELR3, CSK, PTGS1, and PTGS2. Preferable consistency of the diagnostic mole and 
real conditions was observed in all four cohorts (GSE55235: Kappa=1.000, 
P<0.001; GSE55457: Kappa=0.700, P<0.001; GSE82107: Kappa=0.643, P=0.004; 
GSE1919: Kappa=1.000, P<0.001). KDELR3 was expressed at higher levels in OA 
patients than were the other genes, and with the help of immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), we confirmed that OA patients presented high levels of KDELR3 in synovial 
tissues. The infiltration of immunocytes, macrophages, and natural killer T 
cells was high in OA patients. KDELR3 might be involved in the activation and 
infiltration of effector memory CD4 T cells (Rpearson = 0.58, P < 0.001) and 
natural killer T cells (Rpearson = 0.53, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: We constructed and validated a six-gene diagnostic model for OA 
patients via machine learning, and KDELR3 emerged as a novel biomarker for OA."
"PURPOSE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease. 
However, its etiology remains largely unknown. Zinc Finger Protein 652 (ZNF652) 
is a transcription factor implicated in various biological processes. 
Nevertheless, its role in OA has not been elucidated.
METHODS: The search term ""osteoarthritis"" was utilized to procure transcriptome 
data relating to OA patients and healthy people from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. Then a screening process was initiated to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs were discerned using three 
distinct machine learning methods. The accuracy of these DEGs in diagnosing OA 
was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. A 
competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) visualization network was established to 
delve into potential regulatory targets. The ZNF652 expression was confirmed in 
the cartilage of OA rats using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) and analyzed using an 
independent t-test.
RESULTS: ZNF652 was identified as a DEG and exhibited the highest diagnostic 
value for OA according to the ROC analysis. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses 
suggest that ZNF652 plays a vital role in OA development through processes 
including nitric oxide anabolism, macrophage proliferation, immune response, and 
the PI3K/Akt and the MAPK signaling pathways. The increased expression of ZNF652 
in OA was validated in qRT-PCR (1.193 ± 0.005 vs 1.000 ± 0.005, p < 0.001) and 
WB (0.981 ± 0.055 vs 0.856 ± 0.026, p = 0.012) analysis.
CONCLUSION: ZNF652 was found to be related to OA pathogenesis and can 
potentially serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target of OA. The underlying 
mechanism is that ZNF652 was related to nitric oxide anabolism, macrophage 
proliferation, various signaling pathways, and immune cells and their functions 
in OA. Nevertheless, the findings need to be confirmed in clinical trials and 
the molecular mechanism requires further study."
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Esophageal cancer-related gene-4 (ECRG4) participate in 
inflammation process and can interact with the innate immunity complex 
TLR4-MD2-CD14 on human granulocytes. In addition, ECRG4 participate in 
modulation of ion channel function and electrical activity of cardiomyocytes. 
However, the exact mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to test our hypothesis 
that ECRG4 contributes to inflammation-induced ion channel dysfunctions in 
cardiomyocytes.
METHODS: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) 
generated from three donors were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to 
establish an endotoxin-induced inflammatory model. Immunostaining, real-time 
PCR, and patch-clamp techniques were used for the study.
RESULTS: ECRG4 was detected in hiPSC-CMs at different differentiation time. LPS 
treatment increased ECRG4 expression in hiPSC-CMs. Knockdown of ECRG4 decreased 
the expression level of Toll-Like-Receptor 4 (TLR4, a LPS receptor) and its 
associated genes and inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, ECRG4 knockdown 
shortened the action potential duration (APD) and intercepted LPS-induced APD 
prolongation by enhancing ISK (small conductance calcium-activated K channel 
current) and attenuating INCX (Na/Ca exchanger current). Overexpression of ECRG4 
mimicked LPS effects on ISK and INCX, which could be prevented by NFκB signaling 
blockers.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that LPS effects on cardiac ion channel 
function were mediated by the upregulation of ECRG4, which affects NFκB 
signaling. Our findings support the roles of ECRG4 in inflammatory responses and 
the ion channel dysfunctions induced by LPS challenge."
"The highly active natural product yatakemycin (YTM) from Streptomyces sp. 
TP-A0356 is a potent DNA damaging agent with antimicrobial and antitumor 
properties. The YTM biosynthesis gene cluster (ytk) contains several toxin 
self-resistance genes. Of these, ytkR2 encodes a DNA glycosylase that is 
important for YTM production and host survival by excising lethal YTM-adenine 
lesions from the genome, presumably initiating a base excision repair (BER) 
pathway. However, the genes involved in repair of the resulting 
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site as the second BER step have not been identified. 
Here, we show that ytkR4 and ytkR5 are essential for YTM production and encode 
deoxyribonucleases related to other known DNA repair nucleases. Purified YtkR4 
and YtkR5 exhibit AP endonuclease activity specific for YtkR2-generated AP 
sites, providing a basis for BER of the toxic AP intermediate produced from 
YTM-adenine excision and consistent with co-evolution of ytkR2, ytkR4, and 
ytkR5. YtkR4 and YtkR5 also exhibit 3'-5' exonuclease activity with differing 
substrate specificities. The YtkR5 exonuclease is capable of digesting through a 
YTM-DNA lesion and may represent an alternative repair mechanism to BER. We also 
show that ytkR4 and ytkR5 homologs are often clustered together in putative gene 
clusters related to natural product production, consistent with non-redundant 
roles in repair of other DNA adducts derived from genotoxic natural products."
"INTRODUCTION: We undertook an in-depth investigation of the data pertaining to 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) to identify potential targets for the 
development of precision therapies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network was based on overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
identified in the GSE16515, GSE32676, and GSE125158 datasets. A subsequent 
bioinformatic analysis was performed on the interconnected genes within the PPI 
network, leading to the identification of the central gene, CENPN. In vitro 
experimentation such as CCK8 and Transwell experiments was employed to elucidate 
the impact of CENPN expression patterns on PAAD cell proliferation, migration, 
and invasion. Furthermore, the investigation revealed through comprehensive 
enrichment analysis that the pivotal signaling pathway associated with CENPN is 
the p53 signaling pathway.
RESULTS: Following a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of 161 concordant 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across three microarray datasets, CENPN 
emerged as the central gene under investigation. Overexpression of CENPN in 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) was associated with unfavorable patient 
outcomes and heightened sensitivity to four PAAD therapies: gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, paclitaxel, and sunitinib. Reduced CENPN expression impeded PAAD cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion; however, these effects were counteracted 
upon upregulation of CENPN expression. Additionally, CENPN interacted with MDM2, 
promoting PAAD progression by targeting the p53 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study substantiate that CENPN is associated 
with the pathogenesis of PAAD. Consequently, CENPN appears to be a promising 
candidate for targeted precision therapy in clinical applications."
"INTRODUCTION: Absence of mismatch repair (MMR) genes in tumor cells or errors in 
the replication repair process may lead to DNA-MMR deficiency and microsatellite 
instability (MSI) formation. Specific tumor environments where gene variations 
are observed are believed to be conducive to the formation of MSI. This study 
aimed to determine the MSI status, MMR protein expression, and somatic mutation 
profile in solid organ tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, the records of 192 patients with solid 
organ tumors who were referred to the Molecular Pathology Laboratory between 
January 2018 and December 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. The MSI profiles 
of the patients were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
and immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. Somatic variations in the patients were 
detected using an NGS colon cancer panel.
RESULTS: In the IHC evaluation, 22 cases showed MMR-deficient (dMMR) or high MSI 
(MSI-H), and 170 cases showed MMR-proficient (pMMR) or microsatellite stable 
(MSS). Real-time PCR results on the 22 dMMR cases revealed that 11 cases had 
MSI-H and 11 cases had MSS status. Among the 170 cases with pMMR, 160 cases were 
found to have MSS status, while 10 cases had low MSI (MSI-L). NGS analysis 
revealed that the three most frequent pathogenic variants in all cases were BLM 
exon 7 c.1544delA, MSH3 exon 7 c.1148delA, and MLH3 exon 2 c.1755delA. MSI-H 
cancer patients had a higher variation burden compared to MSS cancer patients. 
The most frequently observed pathogenic variant in both MSI-H and MSS cancer 
patients was BLM exon 7 c.1544delA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study covers not only colorectal cancer patients but also other 
solid tumor types, providing the first data from the Turkish population on the 
MSI-H/dMMR status and somatic mutation profile in the presence of this 
condition."
"The section Aspergillus includes xerophilic fungi that are economically 
significant and broadly distributed in natural settings as well as human 
habitats and are recognized for their sustenance on substrates with low water 
activity. Accurate identification of fungal species is essential for any 
reliable advances in mycological research. In this study, 108 strains from the 
section Aspergillus, originating from Korea and conserved at the Korean 
Agricultural Culture Collection, were subjected to re-identification using a 
combined dataset that included partial sequences of β-tubulin (BenA), Calmodulin 
(CaM), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) genes, along with 
their morphological characteristics. We confirmed the presence of 12 species 
among the 108 strains originally isolated from Korea. Of them, nine species have 
been formerly reported in Korea (Aspergillus chevalieri, Aspergillus cibarius, 
Aspergillus cumulatus, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus montevidensis, 
Aspergillus proliferans, Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, Aspergillus ruber, and 
Aspergillus tonophilus), and 3 species (Aspergillus aurantiacoflavus, 
Aspergillus intermedius, and Aspergillus niveoglaucus) were found to be 
previously unreported to be isolated from Korea. Here, the detailed 
characteristic features of these three unexplored species are presented, 
including specific morphological traits, genetic variations, and ecological 
niches in Korea."
"Pseudoperonospora cubensis is a significant phytopathogen causing downy mildew 
disease in cucurbit crops. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
interaction between P. cubensis and its host is essential for developing 
effective disease management strategies. RxLR effectors, secreted by pathogens, 
play a crucial role in modulating host immunity. In this study, we sequenced the 
genome of the P. cubensis isolate CNU-OTH and identified RxLR effector genes 
using bioinformatics tools. A total of 45 RxLR effector genes were identified 
from the genome of P. cubensis. Cloning and functional characterization of these 
effectors were performed through transient expression assays in Nicotiana 
benthamiana leaves. Subcellular localization of selected effectors was 
determined using GFP-tagged constructs. Functional characterization revealed 
that while most effectors did not induce a hypersensitive response (HR), a 
subset showed either weak or strong necrosis. Furthermore, several effectors 
demonstrated the ability to suppress cell death induced by BAX and INF1. 
Subcellular localization analysis indicated that RxLR effectors exhibited 
fluorescence in the nucleus and plasma membrane of N. benthamiana cells, 
suggesting diverse roles in host-pathogen interactions. This study provides 
insights into the genetic diversity and functional characterization of RxLR 
effectors in P. cubensis. Understanding the role of these effectors in 
manipulating host immunity is critical for developing strategies to combat downy 
mildew disease in cucurbit crops. The findings contribute to the broader 
understanding of plant-pathogen interactions and may facilitate the development 
of disease-resistant crop varieties."
"BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent subtype of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), characterized by poor prognosis and a high 
mortality rate. Identifying reliable prognostic biomarkers and potential 
therapeutic targets is crucial for improving patient outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of HJURP expression in LUAD using 
data from four cohorts: TCGA-LUAD (n = 453), GSE31210 (n = 226), GSE68465 (n = 
442), and GSE72094 (n = 386). Univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to 
identify prognostic genes, with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis used to assess 
the predictive power of HJURP. Functional enrichment analyses were performed 
using MetaScape and FGSEA, and spatial transcriptomics and single-cell 
sequencing data were analyzed to explore HJURP's distribution and potential 
functions. Additionally, correlations between HJURP expression and genetic 
alterations, immune cell infiltration, and potential therapeutic responses were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: HJURP was identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in all four 
cohorts, with high expression associated with increased risk of overall survival 
(OS) death (TCGA-LUAD: HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.321-2.815, P < 0.001; GSE31210: HR = 
2.75, 95% CI: 1.319-5.735, P = 0.007; GSE68465: HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.215-2.038, 
P < 0.001; GSE72094: HR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.485-3.27, P < 0.001). Functional 
analyses indicated that HJURP is involved in DNA metabolic processes, cell cycle 
regulation, and mitotic processes, with significant activation of pathways 
related to MYC targets, G2M checkpoint, and DNA repair. High HJURP expression 
was associated with higher mutation frequencies in TP53, CSMD3, TTN, and MUC16, 
and positively correlated with pro-inflammatory immune cell infiltration and 
several immune checkpoints, including PD-L1 and PD-L2. Chemotherapeutic agents 
such as gefitinib and sorafenib were predicted to be effective against high 
HJURP-expressing tumors.
CONCLUSION: HJURP is a pivotal biomarker for LUAD, consistently associated with 
poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. Its high expression correlates with 
specific genetic alterations and immune profiles, highlighting its potential as 
a therapeutic target. Future studies should validate these findings in larger 
cohorts."
"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to play an essential 
role in the early stages of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Inducible EMT 
models can initiate EMT in a controlled manner, thereby providing the 
opportunity to determine whether a cancer-associated gene influences cancer 
metastasis by triggering EMT. Moreover, different inducible EMT models enable 
the investigation of specific mechanisms of EMT modulation by various genes, 
facilitating a more precise understanding of how these genes influence cancer 
metastasis through the induction of EMT. Unfortunately, current inducible EMT 
models still present unmet needs. Therefore, we aimed to establish an inducible 
EMT model in MCF10A cells, a spontaneously immortalized human fibrocystic 
mammary cell line, by manipulating the expression of mouse Twist1 (mTwist1). In 
this study, we first compared the EMT induction capacity between human TWIST1 
(hTWIST1) and mTwist1, and selected mTwist1 for further investigation. By 
monitoring the changes in epithelial and mesenchymal markers at different 
induction time points, we examined the EMT process in both polyclonal and 
monoclonal MCF10A cells that express doxycycline (DOX)-inducible mTwist1. 
Furthermore, our results showed that doxycycline-induced mTwist1 expression 
triggered EMT at a similar rate to TGFβ1-induced EMT in MCF10A cells. 
Additionally, this process was reversible upon DOX withdrawal. Thus, we have 
established a robust inducible EMT model in MCF10A cells, which can be used to 
further study cancer metastasis-driving genes."
"INTRODUCTION: Increasing reactive oxygen species levels can be considered a 
threatening agent for male infertility. Phoenix dactylifera pollen (Date palm 
pollen, DPP) positively affects sperm parameters, which has been well documented 
in animal models. This study aimed to determine the effects of DPP on sperm 
parameters, expression of antioxidant genes, and activation of antioxidant 
enzymes in infertile men.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This randomized and comparative clinical trial included 
20 fertile and 60 infertile men referred to Om-e-Leila Hospital in Bandar Abbas, 
Hormozgan, Iran, during 2016 (March)-17 (June). Sample collection of infertile 
cases was performed before and after using capsules of DPP powder for 30 
consecutive days for semen analysis. Semen samples of fertile men were extracted 
as the controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed 
for RNA extraction to peruse the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 
(NRF2), superoxide dismutase (SOD2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and 
catalase (CAT) genes. In the end, we used SPSS 16.0 for statistical analyses.
RESULTS: After using DPP, there was a significant enhancement in the expression 
of NRF2, GPX4, SOD2, and CAT genes (p = 0.001. However, in the control group, 
the expression of antioxidant genes was higher than that in the experimental 
group after the treatment, except for the SOD2 gene (p = 0.16). Our findings 
also showed that the mean activity of the GPX4, SOD2, and CAT enzymes was higher 
in the treatment group compared to the control group. There was a correlation 
between DPP use, expression of antioxidant genes, and the count, volume, 
motility, and morphology of sperm.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Administering DPP improves semen quality and 
positively affects the expression of NRF2, SOD2, CAT, and GPX4 genes in 
infertile men. More studies are suggested to support this hypothesis."
"Healthcare in low- and middle-income countries is becoming problematic due to 
the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria causing serious morbidity and 
mortality. Klebsiella variicola carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 
genes was found significantly among sepsis patients in a study done between 
October 2019 and September 2020 at four Ethiopian hospitals located in the 
central (Tikur Anbessa and Yekatit 12), southern (Hawassa), and northern 
(Dessie) parts. Among 1416 sepsis patients, 74 K. variicola isolates were 
identified using MALDI-TOF, most of them at Dessie (n=44) and Hawassa (n=28) 
hospitals. Whole genome sequencing showed that K. variicola strains identified 
at Dessie Hospital displayed phylogenetic clonality, carried an IncM1 plasmid 
and the majority were ST3924. Many K. variicola identified at Hawassa Hospital 
were clonally clustered and the majority belonged to novel STs and carried 
IncFIB(K) and IncFII(K) plasmids concurrently. Fifty K. variicola carried ESBL 
genes while 2 isolates harbored AmpC. Other frequently found genes were 
aac(3)-lla, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1B, blaLEN2, blaOXA-1, blaSCO-1, catB3, dfrA14, 
QnrB1, aac(6')-lb-cr and sul2. Virulence genes detected at both sites were mrk 
operons for biofilm formation and siderophore ABC transporter operons for iron 
uptake. Capsular alleles varied, with wzi 269 at Dessie and wzi 582 at Hawassa. 
The isolation of multidrug-resistant K. variicola as an emerging sepsis pathogen 
calls for strong infection prevention strategies and antimicrobial stewardship 
supported by advanced bacterial identification techniques."
"BACKGROUND: Alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase (ALG8), a key enzyme in protein 
glycosylation, is implicated in the oncogenesis and progression of several human 
malignancies. This study aimed to define the role of ALG8 in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) and uncover its mechanisms of action.
METHODS: ALG8 expression in HCC and normal tissues was analyzed using the TCGA 
and GEO databases, validated by RT-qPCR and western blot. Survival outcomes were 
evaluated via Cox analyses, and ALG8's impact on HCC behavior was examined 
through functional assays. GO, KEGG, and GSEA identified ALG8-related pathways, 
validated by biochemical assays.
RESULTS: In bioinformatics analyses, ALG8 was overexpressed in HCC tissues (p < 
0.05 for all comparisons) and correlated with poorer survival (p = 0.006 and 
p = 0.025, respectively), establishing its role as an independent prognostic 
factor. In vitro experiments showed that knockdown of ALG8 reduced HCC cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion. Using the STRING platform and TCGA-LIHC 
dataset, we identified ALG8-interacting genes and their associated 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). GO and KEGG analyses further linked ALG8 
to genes involved in glycosylation, signal release, and other processes, as well 
as pathways including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and N-Glycan 
biosynthesis. GSEA, corroborated by western blot and immunofluorescence, points 
to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade as a probable mechanistic pathway through 
which ALG8 may modulate HCC progression.
CONCLUSION: Elevated ALG8 expression in HCC is linked to worse outcomes and 
increased tumor aggressiveness, with silencing ALG8 reducing Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling, highlighting ALG8 as a potential therapeutic target."
