hypomethylated DNA signature of human motor neurons.","Harvey C, Nowak A, Zhang S, Moll T, Weimer AK, Barcons AM, Souza CDS, Ferraiuolo

by relatively selective toxicity to motor neurons (MN). As others have 
highlighted, this offers an opportunity to develop a sensitive and specific 
biomarker based on detection of DNA released from dying MN within accessible 
biofluids. Here we have performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of 
iPSC-derived MN from neurologically normal individuals. By comparing MN 
methylation with an atlas of tissue methylation we have derived a MN-specific 
signature of hypomethylated genomic regions, which accords with genes important 
for MN function. Through simulation we have optimised the selection of regions 
for biomarker detection in plasma and CSF cell-free DNA (cfDNA). However, we 
show that MN-derived DNA is not detectable via WGBS in plasma cfDNA. In support 
of our experimental finding, we show theoretically that the relative sparsity of 
lower MN sets a limit on the proportion of plasma cfDNA derived from MN which is 
below the threshold for detection of WGBS. Our findings are important for the 
ongoing development of ALS biomarkers. The MN-specific hypomethylated genomic 
regions we have derived could be usefully combined with more sensitive detection 
methods and perhaps with study of CSF instead of plasma. Indeed we demonstrate 
that neuronal-derived DNA is detectable in CSF. Our work is relevant for all 
diseases featuring death of rare cell-types.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-5397445/v1

underlying mechanisms remaining unknown. To determine whether immune dysfunction 
in the lung contributes to TB susceptibility, we obtained paired human alveolar 
macrophages (HAMs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from TB-exposed 
individuals with/without T2D. Upon infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(M.tb), T2D-HAMs had more M.tb growth and produced more TNF. There were fewer 
neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage of T2D patients which was inversely 
correlated with M.tb growth. Both T2D-HAMs and MDMs expressed less CD32, with 
T2D patients having fewer M1-like MDMs. T2D-MDMs produced less IL-1RA and CSF2. 
Overall M.tb-induced gene expression was delayed in T2D-HAMs, but genes involved 
in negative regulation of neutrophil migration were upregulated. T2D-HAM DNA was 
hypermethylated compared to control HAMs, however genes linked to TNF signalling 
were hypomethylated. We show here the first in-depth analysis of T2D-HAMs 
providing an explanation for more severe TB in T2D patients.","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-5489046/v1
