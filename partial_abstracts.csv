in Cdh23 Erl/Erl Mice.","Ma W, Li H, Hu J, Gao Y, Zhang X, Xu M, Cheng Y.","CONTEXT: In normal physiological conditions, calcium ions (Ca2+) have an 
important effect in terms of the regulation of hair cell (HC) functions, and 
T-type calcium antagonists may be protective against hearing loss. However, no 
studies have occurred related to a T-type calcium-channel antagonist with regard 
to otoprotection in a Cdh23 mouse model.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to examine the protective efficacy of 
ethosuximide-a T-type calcium-channel antagonist-against age-related hearing 
loss in a Cadherin 23 (Cdh23) erl/erl mouse model, to potentially offer an 
insight and foundation for therapy in the near future for patients in clinical 
practice who suffer from age-related hearing loss.
DESIGN: The research team conducted an animal study.
ANIMALS: The animals were 12 male and 12 female, Cdh23 erl/erl mice.
INTERVENTION: The research team randomly divided the mice into two groups, with 
12 mice in each group: (1) the control group, the saline group, which received 
saline at 10 mL/kg of body weight, and (2) the intervention group, the 
ethosuximide group, which received ethosuximide at 10 mL/kg of body weight. Both 
groups received the treatments intraperitoneally every other day, beginning 
postnatally at 7 days until the mice were 8 weeks old.
OUTCOME MEASURES: For both groups, the research team: (1) measured auditory 
brainstem response (ABR); (2) measured distortion product otoacoustic emission 
(DPOAE) at 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age; (3) separated the basilar membrane from the 
modiolus and lateral tissues and determined the percentage of inner-and-outer 
hair-cell (IHC and OHC) loss; (4) investigated relative levels of 
apoptosis-related gene mRNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR); and (5) examined relative levels of apoptosis-related protein, 
using immunofluorescent (IF) staining.
RESULTS: Compared to the saline group, the ethosuximide group: (1) had 
significantly lower ABR thresholds for click at 8 weeks, for 8 KHz at 6 and 8 
weeks, and for 16 KHz and 32 KHz (all P < .01); (2) had significantly higher 
DPOAE amplitudes at 4 weeks at 15.4 KHz and 17.7 KHz (both P < .01); at 6 weeks 
at 8.8 KHz (P < .05), 10.1 KHz (P < .01), 11.7 KHz (P < .01), 13.4 KHz (P < 
.01), 15.4 KHz (P < .01), and 17.7 KHz (P < .01); and at 8 weeks at 6.7 KHz (P < 
.05), 7.7 KHz (P < .05), 10.1 KHz (P < .01), 11.7 KHz (P < .01), 13.4 KHz (P < 
.01), 15.4 KHz (P < .01), and 17.7 KHz (P < .01); (3) had significantly lower 
OHC loss in the middle and basal turns of the cochlea's surface (both P < .05); 
(4) at the age of 2 months, had significantly lower mRNA relative levels of 
apoptosis-related genes, including caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-12, m-calpain 
and u-calpain, as found using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and (5) had 
weaker protein levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the inner ears, as found 
using immunofluorescent (IF) staining.
CONCLUSIONS: T-type calcium-channel antagonists can exert protective efficacy in 
terms of the hearing function among cdh23 erl/erl mouse.",PMID: 39480672
